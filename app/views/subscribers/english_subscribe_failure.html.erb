They are aesthetically appealing and often powerfully inspiring, but for a person who is thirsting - even dying - a beautiful way of describing the road that leads to the well is not as important as a clear, precise and succint way. Also, the precision has an aesthetic of its own, a clear and luminous beauty like the beauty of a precious diamond."') %>
